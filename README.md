# AI Anomaly Detection System

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an AI-based Anomaly Detection System that identifies abnormal or suspicious behavior in system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and request rates.

The system uses Unsupervised Machine Learning to learn normal behavior patterns and automatically flag anomalies. This approach is commonly used in fraud detection, cybersecurity, cloud monitoring, and server health analysis.
